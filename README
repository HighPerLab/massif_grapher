massif_grapher is an attempt to generate graphs from the valgring massif output 
that are prettier than the ASCII graphs generated by massif's ms_print script, 
and hopefully more like the old-style graphs created by massif.
These prettier graphs might actually be less accurate or less informative.

It is based on the original ms_print code.
